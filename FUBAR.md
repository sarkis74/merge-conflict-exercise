In the meantime, Bob & Carol have switched to Bob's laptop, started a new feature branch in FUBAR.md, and started working on it. They did not do a git pull origin master and will live to regret it. They finish that feature at the same time that Ted & Alice finish their feature. Each team does an A-C-P and makes a PR. They review each other's PRs and attempt to merge them.
